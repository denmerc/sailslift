To run an app using `node app.js`, you usually need to have a version of `sails` installed in the same directory as your app.
To do that, run `npm install sails`

Alternatively, if you have sails installed globally (i.e. you did `npm install -g sails`), you can use `sails lift`.
When you run `sails lift`, your app will still use a local `./node_modules/sails` dependency if it exists,
but if it doesn't, the app will run with the global sails instead!
